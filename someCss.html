I think that UW is a really great school.  We have top ranked academics including our stellar science programs and hospitals!  We also have a beautiful campus with lots of pretty buildings and brick everywhere! Classes are hard but if you put in work you will be successful!  Work hard play hard and grind to shine.

Only thing I wish is that our school mascot was a corgi! How sick would that be? The Washington Corgis?  Who wouldnt want to go to a school where the mascot was a corgi! Actually might not be that intimidating for sports teams... might get made fun of for that one actually.
